# Mushroom Classification Machine Learning Project

This is a repository for a machine learning approach to mushroom classification, which was our project for the Machine Learning I class on the Master of Science in Data Science at The George Washington University (GWU). All the code is on `mushrooms.ipynb`, which utilizes the following modules:

1.  *NumPy*
2.  *pandas*
3.  *matplotlib.pyplot*
4.  *warnings*
5.  *sklearn*
6. *pydotplus*
7. *IPython.display*

Download this notebook or clone the repository for full reproduction of the results. The repo also holds the project report and the project slides. 

Happy Mushroom Classifying!
